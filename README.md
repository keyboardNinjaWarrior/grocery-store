# Grocery Store

This is a fun game that I decided to made in the middle of first-half of the semester because I thought of it. It's a simple but interactive game in which the conductor offers a special offer to buy whatever with all the money the customer have and earn a special membership. (Weird, right? But, that was our lab task.) At the end, you get the bill, printed on the slip.
